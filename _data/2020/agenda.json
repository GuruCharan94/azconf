They work (mostly) and are a logical solution to your application's data management needs. They've been the standard and that's what's always worked. And then...NoSQL databases came along. You may find that you're now in a spiral of questions: What is this? Is this better than a relational database? What do we need another database technology for? Does this mean there's no structured query language? Do I migrate my existing database to this model? In this talk, I'll answer these questions (and many more) to help you understand the what, how, and why of NoSQL databases as it relates to the modern applications we strive to build today. You'll leave with a definitive guide on NoSQL databases and be confident in deciding whether or not it is the right database solution for you!",

Dapr introduces a runtime to offer such building blocks, and is less invasive in your application, allowing you to pick-and-choose what you need. In this session we will look at the approach that the Dapr runtime takes with a sidecar architecture, separating application logic from the Dapr runtime components. You will also see what it takes to develop distributed applications in .NET Core using Dapr's features and how to bind to messaging infrastructure, cloud resources and use the actor programming model and client proxies. At the end you know what it takes to combine Dapr in your ASP.NET Core applications using routing, controllers or using gRPC clients.",

Your team is suddenly also responsible for monitoring your software in production and detecting and troubleshooting issues. To work together with operation specialists in your team or maybe even embrace a #NoOps approach, you as the developer, need to learn about monitoring. We will discuss logging frameworks and log analytics solutions. Next to that we will explore metrics: your software's KPI's. What metrics to choose and how to gather them. To let information come to us, we will use both logging and metrics to create dashboards and alerts that notify us when things go south. Or better yet: before things go south! Finally, we will combine all of this to see how we can quickly investigate and resolve production issues. Join Henry Been for a demo heavy session, including like NLog, Application Insights, Seq and more to see how to implement all of the above from scratch. During this session, you will learn everything you need to know to start monitoring your solutions and never lose any sleep ever again!",

To take full advantage of the serverless benefits of event-driven, your application needs to scale and react to those events instantly. It needs to be able to scale from zero to potentially thousands of instances. KEDA is an open-sourced component that provides event-driven autoscaling for your Kubernetes workloads. KEDA works with any container, but to enable additional serverless capabilities within Kubernetes you can pair KEDA with the Azure Functions runtime. Don't get fooled by 'Azure' in the name. Azure Functions provides a programming model that can run anywhere: in a container running on-premises, fully managed in Azure, or in any Kubernetes cluster and they can be written in many languages. It allows application developers not to worry anymore about writing the code to connect, trigger, and pull from an event source like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Azure Event Hubs. That’s all handled for you. In this demo-filled session, we will start with a quick introduction to both Kubernetes and Azure Functions. You will then see how you can create your first cluster and install KEDA, deploy a function and scale that to thousands of instances based on events.",

Creating global applications is no easy piece, we can hit a lot of concerns, not only technical but also business related and even legal. In this session, we will check how Azure App Service can helps us reach this global application goal and how other related services, like: Azure Front Door, Traffic Manager, Azure Storage, Azure CDN, Azure Functions, Cognitive Search, Azure Redis Caches, Cosmos DB and messaging services can help you to create a global scale application.

Starting from Decentralized finance, Supply chain management to Self Sovereign Identity, blockchain has shown immense potential to manage transactions across various domains. One of the drawbacks when it comes to working with blockchain is the bandwidth required to deploy your own network and perform operations on it. This is where cloud can make a big difference. Cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure have built Blockchain offerings in a short span of time to address the challenges faced by developers during deployment and operations. With cloud offerings like Azure Blockchain service, everything is available at one-click. This talk is designed for beginners, where I will introduce blockchain and also talk about how blockchain network deployment and operations can be simplified using Azure Blockchain Service.",

But how do we ensure this is done in a secure and governed way? This is where Azure API Management comes in, where we can create a repository of all our APIs, and make sure to expose all of these securely in a standardized manner. In this session we will dive into the most common security hazards, and see how API Management helps us solve these. You will learn all about the strengths and weaknesses of the product, best practices, and how to harden the defenses of your services.",

Together with excellent tooling, gRPC helps you create high throughput, low latency, real-time services. In this talk I'll introduce gRPC and compare it with familiar REST-based JSON APIs. You will see how to create gRPC services on ASP.NET Core, and how to integrate gRPC with dependency injection, logging, and authentication. Learn how to use gRPC to create lightning fast microservices and frontend applications",

It would be great if someone could create a simple application that gets real-time bus information, also allowing the creation of geofence: when the bus enters that area, you know it’s time to leave the office. You can catch the bus right on time and never have to wait for the next one! I’ve been using it for more than a year now and it…just works. Like magic. With the aid of Azure Function, Azure SQL and a service like IFTTT, creating such solutions is fun, and paves the way for improvements and integrations that make people’s lives easier. In this session we’ll analyze the solution from the inside out.",

As we’re designing these systems, it’s important for us to understand how we communicate with these services and also how they communicate with each other. In this session, we will explore some of the options for communicating between distributed services. We’ll see some of the standard protocols and patterns that we can all use today, regardless of whether you’re running in the cloud, on-premises or a little of both.",

Controlling resource deployments on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster can quickly become challenging, particularly when multiple Continuous Delivery pipelines target the same cluster. In such scenarios, you want to build smarts within the Kubernetes cluster to admit or deny pods that do not meet your admission criteria. With Azure Policy for AKS, you can write static admission rules for your Kubernetes cluster. But what if your admission demands are dynamic or you want to roll out custom admission policies? By creating custom admission webhooks for Kubernetes, you can define custom policies that regulate the deployment of resources to a cluster. In this session, we will present how you can administer Azure Policies for AKS and subsequently build a serverless validating admission webhook with Azure Functions to apply governance policies on the deployments in Kubernetes. Azure Functions allow you to integrate with external services without writing a single line of integration code. We will use the Azure Function’s native Twilio binding to send SMS updates on Kubernetes deployments to the Ops/SRE team. After participating in this session, you will understand how easy it is to write custom validating webhooks for Kubernetes. Also, you will learn to build and deploy a serverless infrastructure to certify deployments at scale.",
