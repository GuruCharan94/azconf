    **Session : Interpretable Machine Learning with Python Examples**
sessiontitle: |
    Machine Learning Systems are becoming so ubiquitous in our daily life. With the rise of Blackbox models, ML Solutions based on them are often blamed for lack of transparency and hence its trustworthiness on fairness is being questioned. In some of the countries, the law of the land requires the organization that owns the ML Models to explain its predictions. Hence itâ€™s high time for Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists to practice Interpretable ML which is also referred to as Explainable AI (XAI).

    This talk helps you understand the following:

    What is Interpretable ML / Explainable AI ?
    Why is Interpretability required in Machine Learning?
    How is it relevant to me?
    Types of Interpretability (Global & Local)
    IML with Python References (LIME, SHAP)
