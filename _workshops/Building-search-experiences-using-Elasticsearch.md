    Building a web application to solve a business problem is easy in today's world. But, how about creating an experience that lets your user spend more time on the service. To do that, essentially, we need to equip the application with quintessential features like search. Most of the websites like eCommerce, Food Delivery, Social media rely on search. Search is omnipresent, and one can't ignore the users searching for something on your website.

    If you want the users to spend more time on your service, then the search is the word for you! A feature that would make your service all the more happening and user friendly as your user relies on it totally.
